=head1 NAME

dbmapreduce - reduce all input rows with the same key

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    dbmapreduce [-dMS] [-k KeyField] [-f CodeFile] [-C filter-code] [ReduceCommand [ReduceArguments...]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Group input data by KeyField,
then reduce each group.
The reduce function can be an external program
given by ReduceCommand and ReduceArguments,
or an Perl subroutine given by CODE.

This program thus implements Google-style map/reduce,
but executed sequentially.
With the C<-M> option, the reducer is given multiple groups
(as with Google), but not in any guaranteed order
(while Google guarantees they arive in lexically sorted order).
However without it, a stronger invariant
is provided: each reducer is given exactly one group.

By default the KeyField is the first field in the row.
Unlike Hadoop streaming, the -k KeyField option can explicitly
name where the key is in any column of each input row.

The KeyField used for each Reduce is added to the beginning of each 
row of reduce output.

The reduce function can do anything, emitting one or more output records.
However, it must have the same output field separator as the input data.
(In some cases this case may not occur, for example, input data with -FS
and a reduce function of dbstats.  This bug needs to be fixed in the future.)

Reduce functions default to be shell commands.
However, with C<-C>, one can use arbitrary Perl code
(see the C<-C> option below for details).
the C<-f> option is useful to specify complex Perl code
somewhere other than the command line.

Finally, as a special case, if there are no rows of input,
the reducer will be invoked once with the empty value (if it's an external 
reducer) or with undef (if it's a subroutine).
It is expected to generate the output header,
and it may generate no data rows itself, or a null data row
of its choosing.


Assumptions and requirements:	

By default, data can be provided in arbitrary order
and the program consumes O(number of unique tags) memory,
and O(size of data) disk space.

With the -S option, data must arrive group by tags (not necessarily sorted),
and the program consumes O(number of tags) memory and no disk space.
The program will check and abort if this precondition is not met.

With two -S's, program consumes O(1) memory, but doesn't verify
that the data-arrival precondition is met.

Although painful internally,
the field seperators of the input and the output
can be different.
(Early versions of this tool prohibited such variation.)


=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-k> or B<--key> KeyField

specify which column is the key for grouping (default: the first column)

=item B<-S> or B<--pre-sorted>

Assume data is already grouped by tag.
Provided twice, it removes the validiation of this assertion.

=item B<-M> or B<--multiple-ok>

Assume the ReduceCommand can handle multiple grouped keys,
and the ReduceCommand is responsible for outputting the  
with each output row.
(By default, a separate ReduceCommand is run for each key,
and dbmapreduce adds the key to each output row.)

=item B<-K> or B<--pass-current-key>

Pass the current key as an argument to the external,
non-map-aware ReduceCommand.
This is only done optionally since some external commands 
do not expect an extra argument.
(Internal, non-map-aware Perl reducers are always given 
the current key as an argument.)

=item B<-C FILTER-CODE> or B<--filter-code=FILTER-CODE>

Provide FILTER-CODE, Perl code that generates and returns
a Fsdb::Filter object that implements the reduce function.
The provided code should be an anonymous sub
that creates a Fsdb Filter that implements the reduce object.

The reduce object will then be called with --input and --output
paramters that hook it into a the reduce with queues.

One sample fragment that works is just:

    dbcolstats(qw(--nolog duration))

So this command:

    cat DATA/stats.fsdb | \
	dbmapreduce -k experiment -C 'dbcolstats(qw(--nolog duration))'

is the same as the example

    cat DATA/stats.fsdb | \
	dbmapreduce -k experiment dbcolstats duration

excpet that with C<-C> there is no forking and so things run faster.

If C<dbmapreduce> is invoked from within Perl, then one can use
a code SUB as well:
    dbmapreduce(-k => 'experiment', 
	-C => sub { dbcolstats(qw(--nolong duration)) }); 

The reduce object must consume I<all> input as a Fsdb stream,
and close the output Fsdb stream.  (If this assumption is not
met the map/reduce will be aborted.)

For non-map-reduce-aware filters,
when the filter-generator code runs, C<@_[0]> will be the current key.

=item B<-f CODE-FILE> or B<--code-file=CODE-FILE>

Includes F<CODE-FILE> in the program.
This option is useful for more complicated perl reducer functions.

Thus, if reducer.pl has the code.

    sub make_reducer {
	my($current_key) = @_;
	dbcolstats(qw(--nolog duration));
    }

Then the command

    cat DATA/stats.fsdb | dbmapreduce -k experiment -f reducer.pl -C make_reducer

does the same thing as the example.


=item B<-w> or B<--warnings>

Enable warnings in user supplied code.
Warnings are issued if an external reducer fails to consume all input.
(Default to include warnings.)

=back

=for comment
begin_standard_fsdb_options

This module also supports the standard fsdb options:

=over 4

=item B<-d>

Enable debugging output.

=item B<-i> or B<--input> InputSource

Read from InputSource, typically a file name, or C<-> for standard input,
or (if in Perl) a IO::Handle, Fsdb::IO or Fsdb::BoundedQueue objects.

=item B<-o> or B<--output> OutputDestination

Write to OutputDestination, typically a file name, or C<-> for standard output,
or (if in Perl) a IO::Handle, Fsdb::IO or Fsdb::BoundedQueue objects.

=item B<--autorun> or B<--noautorun>

By default, programs process automatically,
but Fsdb::Filter objects in Perl do not run until you invoke
the run() method.
The C<--(no)autorun> option controls that behavior within Perl.

=item B<--help>

Show help.

=item B<--man>

Show full manual.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Fsdb>.
L<dbmultistats>

=head1 CLASS FUNCTIONS

A few notes about the internal structure:
L<dbmapreduce> uses two to four threads to run.
An optional thread C<$self->{_in_thread}> sorts the input.
The main thread then reads input and groups input by key.
Each group is passed to a
secondary thread C<$self->{_reducer_thread}>
that invokes the reducer on each group
and does any ouptut.
If the reducer is I<not> map-aware, then
we create a final postprocessor thread that 
adds the key back to the output.
Either the reducer or the postprocessor thread do output.
