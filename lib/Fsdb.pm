=head1 NAME

Fsdb - a flat-text database for shell scripting


=cut
our $VERSION = '2.48';

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Fsdb, the flatfile streaming database is package of commands
for manipulating flat-ASCII databases from
shell scripts.  Fsdb is useful to process medium amounts of data (with
very little data you'd do it by hand, with megabytes you might want a
real database).
Fsdb was known as as Jdb from 1991 to Oct. 2008.

Fsdb is very good at doing things like:

=over 4

=item *

extracting measurements from experimental output

=item *

examining data to address different hypotheses

=item *

joining data from different experiments

=item *

eliminating/detecting outliers

=item *

computing statistics on data
(mean, confidence intervals, correlations, histograms)

=item *

reformatting data for graphing programs

=back

Fsdb is built around the idea of a flat text file as a database.
Fsdb files (by convention, with the extension F<.fsdb>),
have a header documenting the schema (what the columns mean),
and then each line represents a database record (or row).

For example:

	#fsdb experiment duration
	ufs_mab_sys 37.2
	ufs_mab_sys 37.3
	ufs_rcp_real 264.5
	ufs_rcp_real 277.9

Is a simple file with four experiments (the rows), 
each with a description, size parameter, and run time
in the first, second, and third columns.

Rather than hand-code scripts to do each special case, Fsdb provides
higher-level functions.  Although it's often easy throw together a
custom script to do any single task, I believe that there are several
advantages to using this library:

=over 4

=item *

these programs provide a higher level interface than plain Perl, so

=over 4

=item **

Fewer lines of simpler code:

    dbrow '_experiment eq "ufs_mab_sys"' | dbcolstats duration

Picks out just one type of experiment and computes statistics on it,
rather than:

    while (<>) { split; $sum+=$F[1]; $ss+=$F[1]**2; $n++; }
    $mean = $sum / $n; $std_dev = ...

in dozens of places.

=back

=item *

the library uses names for columns, so

=over 4

=item **

No more C<$F[1]>, use C<_duration>.

=item **

New or different order columns?  No changes to your scripts!

=back

Thus if your experiment gets more complicated with a size parameter,
so your log changes to:

	#fsdb experiment size duration
	ufs_mab_sys 1024 37.2
	ufs_mab_sys 1024 37.3
	ufs_rcp_real 1024 264.5
	ufs_rcp_real 1024 277.9
	ufs_mab_sys 2048 45.3
	ufs_mab_sys 2048 44.2

Then the previous scripts still work, even though duration is
now the third column, not the second.

=item *

A series of actions are self-documenting (each program records what it does).

=over 4

=item **

No more wondering what hacks were used to compute the
final data, just look at the comments at the end
of the output.

=back

For example, the commands

    dbrow '_experiment eq "ufs_mab_sys"' | dbcolstats duration

add to the end of the output the lines
    #    | dbrow _experiment eq "ufs_mab_sys"
    #    | dbcolstats duration


=item *

The library is mature, supporting large datasets, 
corner cases, error handling, backed by an automated test suite.

=over 4

=item **

No more puzzling about bad output because your custom script
skimped on error checking.

=item **

No more memory thrashing when you try to sort ten million records.

=back

=item *

Fsdb-2.x supports Perl scripting (in addition to shell scripting),
with libraries to do Fsdb input and output, and easy support for pipelines.
The shell script

    dbcol name test1 | dbroweval '_test1 += 5;'

can be written in perl as:

    dbpipeline(dbcol(qw(name test1)), dbroweval('_test1 += 5;'));

=back

(The disadvantage is that you need to learn what functions Fsdb provides.)

Fsdb is built on flat-ASCII databases.  By storing data in simple text
files and processing it with pipelines it is easy to experiment (in
the shell) and look at the output.  
To the best of my knowledge, the original implementation of
this idea was C</rdb>, a commercial product described in the book
I<UNIX relational database management: application development in the UNIX environment>
by Rod Manis, Evan Schaffer, and Robert Jorgensen (and
also at the web page L<http://www.rdb.com/>).  Fsdb is an incompatible
re-implementation of their idea without any accelerated indexing or
forms support.  (But it's free, and probably has better statistics!).

Fsdb-2.x supports threading and will exploit multiple processors or cores,
and provides Perl-level support for input, output, and threaded-pipelines.

Installation instructions follow at the end of this document. 
Fsdb-2.x requires Perl 5.8 to run.  
All commands have manual pages and provide usage with the C<--help> option.
All commands are backed by an automated test suite.

The most recent version of Fsdb is available on the web at
L<http://www.isi.edu/~johnh/SOFTWARE/FSDB/index.html>.


=head1 WHAT'S NEW

=head2 2.48, 2014-01-03
small bugfixes and improved release engineering

=over 4

=item ENHANCEMENT

Test suites now skip tests for libraries that are missing.
(Patch for missing C<IO::Compresss:Xz> contributed by Calvin Ardi.)

=item ENHANCEMENT

Removed references to Jdb in the package specification.
Since the name was changed in 2008, there's no longer a huge
need for backwards compatability.
(Suggestion form Petr Å abata.)

=item ENHANCEMENT

Test suites now invoke the perl using the path from C<$Config{perlpath}>.
Hopefully this helps testing in environments where there are multiple installed
perls and the default perl is not the same as the perl-under-test
(as happens in cpantesters.org).

=item BUG FIX

Added specific encoding to this manpage to account for 
Unicode.  Required to build correctly against perl-5.18.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Fsdb now uses the standard Perl build and installation from
ExtUtil::MakeMaker(3), so the quick answer to installation is to type:
    
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

Or, if you want to install it somewhere else, change the first line to

    perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME

and it will go in your home directory's F<bin>, etc.
(See L<ExtUtil::MakeMaker(3)> for more details.)

Fsdb requires perl 5.8 or later and uses ithreads.

A test-suite is available, run it with

    make test

A FreeBSD port to Fsdb is available, see
L<http://www.freshports.org/databases/fsdb/>.

A Fink (MacOS X) port is available, see
L<http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/fsdb>.
(Thanks to Lars Eggert for maintaining this port.)


=head1 BASIC DATA FORMAT

These programs are based on the idea storing data in simple ASCII
files.  A database is a file with one header line and then data or
comment lines.  For example:

	#fsdb account passwd uid gid fullname homedir shell
	johnh * 2274 134 John_Heidemann /home/johnh /bin/bash
	greg * 2275 134 Greg_Johnson /home/greg /bin/bash
	root * 0 0 Root /root /bin/bash
	# this is a simple database

The header line must be first and begins with C<#h>.
There are rows (records) and columns (fields),
just like in a normal database.
Comment lines begin with C<#>.
Column names are any string not containing spaces or single quote
(although it is prudent to keep them alphanumeric with underscore).

By default, columns are delimited by whitespace.  
With this default configuration, the contents of a field
cannot contain whitespace.
However, this limitation can be relaxed by changing the field separator
as described below.

The big advantage of simple flat-text databases is that 
it is usually easy to massage data into this format,
and it's reasonably easy to take data out of this
format into other (text-based) programs, like gnuplot, jgraph, and
LaTeX.  Think Unix.  Think pipes.
(Or even output to Excel and HTML if you prefer.)

Since no-whitespace in columns was a problem for some applications,
there's an option which relaxes this rule.  You can specify the field
separator in the table header with C<-F x> where C<x> is 
a code for the new field separator.
A full list of codes is at L<dbfilealter(1)>,
but two common special values are C<-F t>
which is a separator of a single tab character,
and C<-F S>, a separator of two spaces.
Both allowing (single) spaces in fields.  An example:

	#fsdb -F S account passwd uid gid fullname homedir shell
	johnh  *  2274  134  John Heidemann  /home/johnh  /bin/bash
	greg  *  2275  134  Greg Johnson  /home/greg  /bin/bash
	root  *  0  0  Root  /root  /bin/bash
	# this is a simple database

See L<dbfilealter(1)> for more details.  Regardless of what the column
separator is for the body of the data, it's always whitespace in the
header.

There's also a third format: a "list".  Because it's often hard to see
what's columns past the first two, in list format each "column" is on
a separate line.  The programs dblistize and dbcolize convert to and
from this format, and all programs work with either formats.
The command

    dbfilealter -R C  < DATA/passwd.fsdb

outputs:

	#fsdb -R C account passwd uid gid fullname homedir shell
	account:  johnh
	passwd:   *
	uid:      2274
	gid:      134
	fullname: John_Heidemann
	homedir:  /home/johnh
	shell:    /bin/bash
	
	account:  greg
	passwd:   *
	uid:      2275
	gid:      134
	fullname: Greg_Johnson
	homedir:  /home/greg
	shell:    /bin/bash
	
	account:  root
	passwd:   *
	uid:      0
	gid:      0
	fullname: Root
	homedir:  /root
	shell:    /bin/bash
	
	# this is a simple database
	#  | dblistize 

See L<dbfilealter(1)> for more details.


=head1 BASIC DATA MANIPULATION

A number of programs exist to manipulate databases.
Complex functions can be made by stringing together commands
with shell pipelines.  For example, to print the home
directories of everyone with ``john'' in their names,
you would do:

	cat DATA/passwd | dbrow '_fullname =~ /John/' | dbcol homedir

The output might be:

	#fsdb homedir
	/home/johnh
	/home/greg
	# this is a simple database
	#  | dbrow _fullname =~ /John/
	#  | dbcol homedir

(Notice that comments are appended to the output listing each command,
providing an automatic audit log.)

In addition to typical database functions (select, join, etc.) there
are also a number of statistical functions.

The real power of Fsdb is that one can apply arbitary code to rows
to do powerful things.

	cat DATA/passwd | dbroweval '_fullname =~ s/(\w+)_(\w+)/$2,_$1/'

converts "John_Heidemann" into "Heidemann,_John".
Not too much more work could split fullname into firstname and lastname
fields.


=head1 TALKING ABOUT COLUMNS

An advantage of Fsdb is that you can talk about columns by name
(symbolically) rather than simply by their positions.  So in the above
example, C<dbcol homedir> pulled out the home directory column, and
C<dbrow '_fullname =~ /John/'> matched against column fullname.

In general, you can use the name of the column listed on the C<#fsdb> line
to identify it in most programs, and _name to identify it in code.

Some alternatives for flexibility:

=over 4

=item *

Numeric values identify columns positionally, numbering from 0.
So 0 or _0 is the first column, 1 is the second, etc.

=item *

In code, _last_columnname gets the value from columname's previous row.

=back

See L<dbroweval(1)> for more details about writing code.



=head1 LIST OF COMMANDS

Enough said.  I'll summarize the commands, and then you can
experiment.  For a detailed description of each command, see a summary
by running it with the argument C<--help> (or C<-?> if you prefer.)
Full manual pages can be found by running the command
with the argument C<--man>, or running the Unix command C<man dbcol>
or whatever program you want.

=over 4

=item B<-?> or B<--help>

Show basic usage.

=item B<-N> on B<--new-name>

When a command creates a new column like L<dbrowaccumulate>'s C<accum>,
this option lets one override the default name of that new column.

=item B<-T TmpDir>

where to put tmp files.
Also uses environment variable TMPDIR, if -T is 
not specified.
Default is /tmp.

Show basic usage.

=item B<-c FRACTION> or B<--confidence FRACTION>

Specify confidence interval FRACTION (L<dbcolstats>, L<dbmultistats>, etc.)

=item B<-C S> or C<--element-separator S>

=item B<-d> or B<--debug>

Enable debugging (may be repeated for greater effect in some cases).

=item B<-a> or B<--include-non-numeric>

Compute stats over all data (treating non-numbers as zeros).
(By default, things that can't be treated as numbers
are ignored for stats purposes)

=item B<-S> or B<--pre-sorted>

Assume the data is pre-sorted.
May be repeated to disable verification (saving a small amount of work).

=item B<-e E> or B<--empty E>

give value E as the value for empty (null) records

=item B<-i I> or B<--input I>

Input data from file I.

=item B<-o O> or B<--output O>

Write data out to file O.

=item B<--nolog>.

Skip logging the program in a trailing comment.

=back

When giving Perl code (in L<dbrow> and L<dbroweval>)
column names can be embedded if preceded by underscores.
Look at L<dbrow(1)> or L<dbroweval(1)> for examples.)

Most programs run in constant memory and use temporary files if necessary.
Exceptions are L<dbcolneaten>, L<dbcolpercentile>, L<dbmapreduce>,
L<dbmultistats>, L<dbrowsplituniq>.


=head1 ANOTHER EXAMPLE

Take the raw data in C<DATA/http_bandwidth>,
put a header on it (C<dbcoldefine size bw>),
took statistics of each category (C<dbmultistats -k size bw>),
pick out the relevant fields (C<dbcol size mean stddev pct_rsd>), and you get:

	#fsdb size mean stddev pct_rsd
	1024    1.4962e+06      2.8497e+05      19.047
	10240   5.0286e+06      6.0103e+05      11.952
	102400  4.9216e+06      3.0939e+05      6.2863
	#  | dbcoldefine size bw
	#  | /home/johnh/BIN/DB/dbmultistats -k size bw
	#  | /home/johnh/BIN/DB/dbcol size mean stddev pct_rsd

(The whole command was:

	cat DATA/http_bandwidth |
	dbcoldefine size |
	dbmultistats -k size bw |
	dbcol size mean stddev pct_rsd

all on one line.)

Then post-process them to get rid of the exponential notation
by adding this to the end of the pipeline:

    dbroweval '_mean = sprintf("%8.0f", _mean); _stddev = sprintf("%8.0f", _stddev);'

(Actually, this step is no longer required since L<dbcolstats>
now uses a different default format.)

giving:

	#fsdb      size    mean    stddev  pct_rsd
	1024     1496200          284970        19.047
	10240    5028600          601030        11.952
	102400   4921600          309390        6.2863
	#  | dbcoldefine size bw
	#  | dbmultistats -k size bw
	#  | dbcol size mean stddev pct_rsd
	#  | dbroweval   { _mean = sprintf("%8.0f", _mean); _stddev = sprintf("%8.0f", _stddev); }

In a few lines, raw data is transformed to processed output.


Suppose you expect there is an odd distribution of results of one
datapoint.  Fsdb can easily produce a CDF (cumulative distribution
function) of the data, suitable for graphing:

    cat DB/DATA/http_bandwidth | \
        dbcoldefine size bw | \
	dbrow '_size == 102400' | \
	dbcol bw | \
	dbsort -n bw | \
	dbrowenumerate | \
	dbcolpercentile count | \
	dbcol bw percentile | \
	xgraph

The steps, roughly:
1. get the raw input data and turn it into fsdb format,
2. pick out just the relevant column (for efficiency) and sort it,
3. for each data point, assign a CDF percentage to it,
4. pick out the two columns to graph and show them


=head1 A GRADEBOOK EXAMPLE

The first commercial program I wrote was a gradebook,
so here's how to do it with Fsdb.

Format your data like DATA/grades.

	#fsdb name email id test1
	a a@ucla.example.edu 1 80
	b b@usc.example.edu 2 70
	c c@isi.example.edu 3 65
	d d@lmu.example.edu 4 90
	e e@caltech.example.edu 5 70
	f f@oxy.example.edu 6 90

Or if your students have spaces in their names, use C<-F S> and two spaces
to separate each column:

	#fsdb -F S name email id test1
	alfred aho  a@ucla.example.edu  1  80
	butler lampson  b@usc.example.edu  2  70
	david clark  c@isi.example.edu  3  65
	constantine drovolis  d@lmu.example.edu  4  90
	debrorah estrin  e@caltech.example.edu  5  70
	sally floyd  f@oxy.example.edu  6  90

To compute statistics on an exam, do

	cat DATA/grades | dbstats test1 |dblistize

giving

	#fsdb -R C  ...
	mean:        77.5
	stddev:      10.84
	pct_rsd:     13.987
	conf_range:  11.377
	conf_low:    66.123
	conf_high:   88.877
	conf_pct:    0.95
	sum:         465
	sum_squared: 36625
	min:         65
	max:         90
	n:           6
	...

To do a histogram:

	cat DATA/grades | dbcolhisto -n 5 -g test1

giving

	#fsdb low histogram
	65      *
	70      **
	75
	80      *
	85
	90      **
	#  | /home/johnh/BIN/DB/dbhistogram -n 5 -g test1

Now you want to send out grades to the students by e-mail.
Create a form-letter (in the file F<test1.txt>):

	To: _email (_name)
	From: J. Random Professor <jrp@usc.example.edu>
	Subject: test1 scores

	_name, your score on test1 was _test1.
	86+   A
	75-85 B
	70-74 C
	0-69  F

Generate the shell script that will send the mail out:

	cat DATA/grades | dbformmail test1.txt > test1.sh

And run it:

	sh <test1.sh

The last two steps can be combined:

	cat DATA/grades | dbformmail test1.txt | sh

but I like to keep a copy of exactly what I send.


At the end of the semester you'll want to compute grade totals and
assign letter grades.  Both fall out of dbroweval.
For example, to compute weighted total grades with a 40% midterm/60%
final where the midterm is 84 possible points and the final 100:

	dbcol -rv total |
	dbcolcreate total - |
	dbroweval '
		_total = .40 * _midterm/84.0 + .60 * _final/100.0;
		_total = sprintf("%4.2f", _total);
		if (_final eq "-" || ( _name =~ /^_/)) { _total = "-"; };' | 
	dbcolneaten  


If you got the data originally from a spreadsheet, save it in
"tab-delimited" format and convert it with tabdelim_to_db
(run tabdelim_to_db -? for examples).


=head1 A PASSWORD EXAMPLE

To convert the Unix password file to db:

	cat /etc/passwd | sed 's/:/  /g'| \
		dbcoldefine -F S login password uid gid gecos home shell \
		>passwd.fsdb

To convert the group file

	cat /etc/group | sed 's/:/  /g' | \
		dbcoldefine -F S group password gid members \
		>group.fsdb

To show the names of the groups that div7-members are in
(assuming DIV7 is in the gecos field):

	cat passwd.fsdb | dbrow '_gecos =~ /DIV7/' | dbcol login gid | \
		dbjoin -i - -i group.fsdb gid | dbcol login group


=head1 SHORT EXAMPLES

Which Fsdb programs are the most complicated (based on number of test cases)?

        ls TEST/*.cmd | \

                dbcolneaten

(Answer: L<dbmapreduce>, then L<dbcolstats>, L<dbfilealter> and L<dbjoin>.)


Stats on an exam (in C<$FILE>, where C<$COLUMN> is the name of the exam)?

	cat $FILE | dbcolstats -q 4 $COLUMN <$FILE | dblistize | dbstripcomments

	cat $FILE | dbcolhisto -g -n 20 $COLUMN | dbcolneaten | dbstripcomments


Merging a the hw1 column from file hw1.fsdb into grades.fsdb assuing
there's a common student id in column "id":

	dbcol id hw1 <hw1.fsdb >t.fsdb

	dbjoin -a -e - grades.fsdb t.fsdb id | \
	    dbsort  name | \
	    dbcolneaten >new_grades.fsdb


Merging two fsdb files with the same rows:

	cat file1.fsdb file2.fsdb >output.fsdb

or if you want to clean things up a bit

	cat file1.fsdb file2.fsdb | dbstripextraheaders >output.fsdb

or if you want to know where the data came from

	for i in 1 2
	do
		dbcolcreate source $i < file$i.fsdb
	done >output.fsdb

(assumes you're using a Bourne-shell compatible shell, not csh).
	

=head1 WARNINGS

As with any tool, one should (which means I<must>) understand
the limits of the tool.

All Fsdb tools should run in I<constant memory>.
In some cases (such as F<dbcolstats> with quartiles, where the whole input
must be re-read), programs will spool data to disk if necessary.

Most tools buffer one or a few lines of data, so memory
will scale with the size of each line.
(So lines with many columns, or when columns have lots data,
may cause larege memory consumption.)

All Fsdb tools should run in constant or at worst C<n log n> time.

All Fsdb tools use normal Perl math routines for computation.
Although I make every attempt to choose numerically stable algorithms
(although I also welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement),
normal rounding due to computer floating point approximations
can result in inaccuracies when data spans a large range of precisions.
(See for example the F<dbcolstats_extrema> test cases.)

Any requirements and limitations of each Fsdb tool
is documented on its manual page.

If any Fsdb program violates these assumptions,
that is a bug that should be documented
on the tool's manual page or ideally fixed.

Fsdb does depend on Perl's correctness, and Perl (and Fsdb) have
some bugs.  Fsdb should work on perl from version 5.10 onward,
but its use of threads gives bogus warnings in some versions of perl:

=over 4

=item *
perl-5.10 and 5.12 generate warnings "unbalanced string table refcount" and "scalars leaked"
in L<dbmapreduce>

=item *
perl-5.10 generates warning "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar"
in L<dbmultistats>.

=back

To my knowledge these do not the correctness of the output,
other than cluttering it up with warnings.


=head1 HISTORY

There have been three versions of Fsdb;
fsdb 1.0 is a complete re-write of the pre-1995 versions,
and was 
distributed from 1995 to 2007.
Fsdb 2.0 is a significant re-write of the 1.x versions
for reasons described below.

Fsdb (in its various forms) has been used extensively by its author
since 1991.  Since 1995 it's been used by two other researchers at
UCLA and several at ISI.  In February 1998 it was announced to the
Internet.  Since then it has found a few users, some outside where I
work.

=head2 Fsdb 2.0 Rationale

I've thought about fsdb-2.0 for many years, but it was started
in earnest in 2007.  Fsdb-2.0 has the following goals:

=over 4

=item in-one-process processing

While fsdb is great on the Unix command line as a pipeline between
programs, it should I<also> be possible to set it up to run in a single
process.  And if it does so, it should be able to avoid serializing
and deserializing (converting to and from text) data between each module.
(Accomplished in fsdb-2.0: see L<dbpipeline>, although still needs tuning.)

=item clean IO API

Fsdb's roots go back to perl4 and 1991, so the fsdb-1.x library is
very, very crufty.  More than just being ugly (but it was that too),
this made things reading from one format file and writing to another
the application's job, when it should be the library's.
(Accomplished in fsdb-1.15 and improved in 2.0: see L<Fsdb::IO>.)

=item normalized module APIs

Because fsdb modules were added as needed over 10 years,
sometimes the module APIs became inconsistent.
(For example, the 1.x C<dbcolcreate> required an empty
value following the name of the new column,
but other programs specify empty values with the C<-e> argument.)
We should smooth over these inconsistencies.
(Accomplished as each module was ported in 2.0 through 2.7.)

=item everyone handles all input formats

Given a clean IO API, the distinction between "colized"
and "listized" fsdb files should go away.  Any program
should be able to read and write files in any format.
(Accomplished in fsdb-2.1.)

=back

Fsdb-2.0 preserves backwards compatibility where possible,
but breaks it where necessary to accomplish the above goals.
In August 2008, fsdb-2.7 was declared preferred over the 1.x versions.

=head1 RELATED WORK

As stated in the introduction, Fsdb is an incompatible reimplementation
of the ideas found in C</rdb>.  By storing data in simple text files and
processing it with pipelines it is easy to experiment (in the shell)
and look at the output.  The original implementation of this idea was
/rdb, a commercial product described in the book I<UNIX relational
database management: application development in the UNIX environment>
by Rod Manis, Evan Schaffer, and Robert Jorgensen (and also at the web
page L<http://www.rdb.com/>).

While Fsdb is inspired by Rdb, it includes no code from it,
and Fsdb makes several different design choices.
In particular: rdb attempts to be closer to a "real" database,
with provision for locking, file indexing.
Fsdb focuses on single user use and so eschews these choices.
Rdb also has some support for interactive editing.
Fsdb leaves editing to text editors like emacs or vi.

In August, 2002 I found out Carlo Strozzi extended RDB with his
package NoSQL L<http://www.linux.it/~carlos/nosql/>.  According to
Mr. Strozzi, he implemented NoSQL in awk to avoid the Perl start-up of
RDB.  Although I haven't found Perl startup overhead to be a big
problem on my platforms (from old Sparcstation IPCs to 2GHz
Pentium-4s), you may want to evaluate his system.
The Linux Journal has a description of NoSQL
at L<http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3294>.
It seems quite similar to Fsdb.
Like /rdb, NoSQL supports indexing (not present in Fsdb).
Fsdb appears to have richer support for statistics,
and, as of Fsdb-2.x, its support for Perl threading may support
faster performance (one-process, less serialization and deserialization).

=item ENHANCEMENT
"talking about columns" section added to README. Lack of documentation pointed out by Lars Eggert.

=item CHANGE
dbformmail now defaults to using Mail ("Berkeley Mail") to send mail, rather than sendmail (sendmail is still an option, but mail doesn't require running as root)

=over 4

=item NEW
fsdb-1.14 added to the MacOS Fink system L<http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/fsdb>. (Thanks to Lars Eggert for maintaining this port.)

=item NEW
Fsdb::IO::Reader and Fsdb::IO::Writer now provide reasonably clean OO I/O interfaces to Fsdb files.  Highly recommended if you use fsdb directly from perl.  In the fullness of time I expect to reimplement the entire thing using these APIs to replace the current dblib.pl which is still hobbled by its roots in perl4.

=item NEW
dbmapreduce now implements a Google-style map/reduce abstraction, generalizing dbmultistats.

=item ENHANCEMENT
fsdb now uses the Perl build system (Makefile.PL, etc.), instead of autoconf.  This change paves the way to better perl-5-style modularization, proper manual pages, input of both listize and colize format for every program, and world peace.

=item ENHANCEMENT
dblib.pl is now moved to Fsdb::Old.pm.

=item BUG FIX
dbmultistats now propagates its format argument (-f). Bug and fix from Martin Lukac (thanks!).

=item ENHANCEMENT
dbformmail documentation now is clearer that it doesn't send the mail, you have to run the shell script it writes.  (Problem observed by Unkyu Park.)

=item ENHANCEMENT
adapted to autoconf-2.61 (and then these changes were discarded in favor of The Perl Way.

=item BUG FIX
dbmultistats memory usage corrected (O(# tags), not O(1))

=item ENHANCEMENT
dbmultistats can now optionally run with pre-grouped input in O(1) memory

=item ENHANCEMENT
dbroweval -N was finally implemented (eat comments)

=back

=head2 2.0, 25-Jan-08

2.0, 25-Jan-08 --- a quiet 2.0 release (gearing up towards complete)

=over 4

=item ENHANCEMENT:
shifting old programs to Perl modules, with
the front-end program as just a wrapper.
In the short-term, this change just means programs have real man pages.
In the long-run, it will mean that one can run a pipeline in a single
Perl program.
So far: 
L<dbcol>,
L<dbroweval>,
the new L<dbrowcount>.
L<dbsort>
the new L<dbmerge>,
the old C<dbstats> (renamed L<dbcolstats>),
L<dbcolrename>,
L<dbcolcreate>,

=item NEW:
L<Fsdb::Filter::dbpipeline> is an internal-only module that lets one
use fsdb commands from within perl (via threads).

It also provides perl function aliases for the internal modules,
so a string of fsdb commands in perl are nearly as terse as in the
shell:

    use Fsdb::Filter::dbpipeline qw(:all);
    dbpipeline(
        dbrow(qw(name test1)),
        dbroweval('_test1 += 5;')
    );

=item INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:
The old L<dbcolstats> has been renamed L<dbcolstatscores>.
The new L<dbcolstats> does the same thing as the old L<dbstats>.
This incompatibility is unfortunate but normalizes program names.

=item CHANGE:
The new L<dbcolstats> program
always outputs C<-> (the default empty value) for
statistics it cannot compute (for example, standard deviation
if there is only one row),
instead of the old mix of C<-> and "na".

=item INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:
The old L<dbcolstats> program, now called L<dbcolstatscores>,
also has different arguments.  The C<-t mean,stddev> option is now
C<--tmean mean --tstddev stddev>.  See L<dbcolstatscores> for details.

=item INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:
L<dbcolcreate> now assumes all new columns get the default 
value rather than requiring each column to have an initial constant value.
To change the initial value, sue the new C<-e> option.

=item NEW:
L<dbrowcount> counts rows, an almost-subset of L<dbcolstats>'s C<n> output
(except without differentiating numeric/non-numeric input),
or the equivalent of C<dbstripcomments | wc -l>.

=item NEW:
L<dbmerge> merges two sorted files.
This functionality was previously embedded in L<dbsort>.

=item INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE:
L<dbjoin>'s C<-i> option to include non-matches
is now renamed C<-a>, so as to not conflict with the new
standard option C<-i> for input file.

=back

=head2 2.1,  6-Apr-08

2.1,  6-Apr-08 --- another alpha 2.0, but now all converted programs understand both listize and colize format

=over 4

=item ENHANCEMENT:
shifting more old programs to Perl modules.
New in 2.1:
L<dbcolneaten>,
L<dbcoldefine>,
L<dbcolhisto>,
L<dblistize>,
L<dbcolize>,
L<dbrecolize>

=item ENHANCEMENT
L<dbmerge> now handles an arbitrary number of input files,
not just exactly two.

=item NEW
L<dbmerge2> is an internal routine that handles merging exactly two files.

=item INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE
L<dbjoin> now specifies inputs like L<dbmerge2>,
rather than assuming the first two arguments were tables (as in fsdb-1).

The old L<dbjoin> argument C<-i> is now C<-a> or <--type=outer>.

A minor change: comments in the source files for
L<dbjoin> are now intermixed with output
rather than being delayed until the end.

=item ENHANCEMENT
L<dbsort> now no longer produces warnings when null values are 
passed to numeric comparisons.

=item BUG FIX
L<dbroweval> now once again works with code that lacks a trailing semicolon.
(This bug fixes a regression from 1.15.)

=item INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE
L<dbcolneaten>'s old C<-e> option (to avoid end-of-line spaces) is now C<-E>
to avoid conflicts with the standard empty field argument.

=item INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE
L<dbcolhisto>'s old C<-e> option is now C<-E> to avoid conflicts.
And its C<-n>, C<-s>, and C<-w> are now
C<-N>, C<-S>, and C<-W> to correspond.

=item NEW
L<dbfilealter> replaces L<dbrecolize>, L<dblistize>, and L<dbcolize>,
but with different options.

=item ENHANCEMENT
The library routines C<Fsdb::IO> now understand both list-format
and column-format data, so all converted programs can now
I<automatically> read either format.  This capability was one
of the milestone goals for 2.0, so yea!

=back

=head2 2.2, 23-May-08

Release 2.2 is another 2.x alpha release.  Now I<most> of the
commands are ported, but a few remain, and I plan one last
incompatible change (to the file header) before 2.x final.

=over 4

=item ENHANCEMENT

shifting more old programs to Perl modules.
New in 2.2:
L<dbrowaccumulate>,
L<dbformmail>.
L<dbcolmovingstats>.
L<dbrowuniq>.
L<dbrowdiff>.
L<dbcolmerge>.
L<dbcolsplittocols>.
L<dbcolsplittorows>.
L<dbmapreduce>.
L<dbmultistats>.
L<dbrvstatdiff>.
Also
L<dbrowenumerate> 
exists only as a front-end (command-line) program.

=item INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE

The following programs have been dropped from fsdb-2.x:
L<dbcoltighten>,
L<dbfilesplit>,
L<dbstripextraheaders>,
L<dbstripleadingspace>.

=item NEW

L<combined_log_format_to_db> to convert Apache logfiles

=item INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE

Options to L<dbrowdiff> are now B<-B> and B<-I>,
not B<-a> and B<-i>.

=item INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE

L<dbstripcomments> is now L<dbfilestripcomments>.

=item BUG FIXES

L<dbcolneaten> better handles empty columns;
L<dbcolhisto> warning suppressed (actually a bug in high-bucket handling).

=item INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE

L<dbmultistats> now requires a C<-k> option in front of the 
key (tag) field, or if none is given, it will group by the first field
(both like L<dbmapreduce>).

=item KNOWN BUG

L<dbmultistats> with quantile option doesn't work currently.

=item INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE

L<dbcoldiff> is renamed L<dbrvstatdiff>.

=item BUG FIXES

L<dbformmail> was leaving its log message as a  command, not a comment.
Oops.  No longer.

=back

=head2 2.3, 27-May-08 (alpha)

Another alpha release, this one just to fix the critical dbjoin bug
listed below (that happens to have blocked my MP3 jukebox :-).

=over 4

=item BUG FIX

Dbsort no longer hangs if given an input file with no rows.

=item BUG FIX

Dbjoin now works with unsorted input coming from a pipeline (like stdin).
Perl-5.8.8 has a bug (?) that was making this case fail---opening
stdin in one thread, reading some, then reading more in a different
thread caused an lseek which works on files, but fails on pipes like stdin.
Go figure.

=item BUG FIX / KNOWN BUG

The dbjoin fix also fixed dbmultistats -q
(it now gives the right answer).
Although a new bug appeared, messages like:
    Attempt to free unreferenced scalar: SV 0xa9dd0c4, Perl interpreter: 0xa8350b8 during global destruction.
So the dbmultistats_quartile test is still disabled.

=back

=head2 2.4, 18-Jun-08

Another alpha release, mostly to fix minor usability
problems in dbmapreduce and client functions.

=over 4

=item ENHANCEMENT

L<dbrow> now defaults to running user supplied code without warnings
(as with fsdb-1.x).
Use C<--warnings> or C<-w> to turn them back on.

=item ENHANCEMENT

L<dbroweval> can now write different format output
than the input, using the C<-m> option.

=item KNOWN BUG

L<dbmapreduce> emits warnings on perl 5.10.0
about "Unbalanced string table refcount" and "Scalars leaked"
when run with an external program as a reducer.

L<dbmultistats> emits the warning "Attempt to free unreferenced scalar"
when run with quartiles.

In each case the output is correct.
I believe these can be ignored.

=item CHANGE

L<dbmapreduce> no longer logs a line for each reducer that is invoked.

=back


=head2 2.5, 24-Jun-08

Another alpha release, fixing more minor bugs in 
C<dbmapreduce> and lossage in C<Fsdb::IO>.

=over 4

=item ENHANCEMENT

L<dbmapreduce> can now tolerate non-map-aware reducers
that pass back the key column in put.
It also passes the current key as the last argument to 
external reducers.

=item BUG FIX

L<Fsdb::IO::Reader>, correctly handle C<-header> option again.
(Broken since fsdb-2.3.)

=back


=head2 2.6, 11-Jul-08

Another alpha release, needed to fix DaGronk.
One new port, small bug fixes, and important fix to L<dbmapreduce>.

=item ENHANCEMENT

shifting more old programs to Perl modules.
New in 2.2:
L<dbcolpercentile>.

=item INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE and ENHANCEMENTS
L<dbcolpercentile> arguments changed,
use C<--rank> to require ranking instead of C<-r>.
Also, C<--ascending> and C<--descending> can now be specified separately,
both for C<--percentile> and C<--rank>.

=item BUG FIX

Sigh, the sense of the --warnings option in L<dbrow> was inverted.  No longer.

=item BUG FIX

I found and fixed the string leaks (errors like "Unbalanced string
table refcount" and "Scalars leaked") in L<dbmapreduce> and L<dbmultistats>.
(All C<IO::Handle>s in threads must be manually destroyed.)

=item BUG FIX

The C<-C> option to specify the column separator in L<dbcolsplittorows> 
now works again (broken since it was ported).

2.7, 30-Jul-08 beta

The beta release of fsdb-2.x.  Finally, all programs are ported.
As statistics, the number of lines of non-library code doubled from
7.5k to 15.5k.  The libraries are much more complete,
going from 866 to 5164 lines.
The overall number of programs is about the same, 
although 19 were dropped and 11 were added.  
The number of test cases has grown from 116 to 175.
All programs are now in perl-5, no more shell scripts or perl-4.
All programs now have manual pages.

Although this is a major step forward, I still expect
to rename "fsdb" to "fsdb".

=over 4

=item ENHANCEMENT

shifting more old programs to Perl modules.
New in 2.7:
L<dbcolscorellate>.
L<dbcolsregression>.
L<cgi_to_db>.
L<dbfilevalidate>.
L<db_to_csv>.
L<csv_to_db>,
L<db_to_html_table>,
L<kitrace_to_db>,
L<tcpdump_to_db>,
L<tabdelim_to_db>,
L<ns_to_db>.

=item INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE

The following programs have been dropped from fsdb-2.x:
L<db2dcliff>,
L<dbcolmultiscale>,
L<crl_to_db>.
L<ipchain_logs_to_db>.
They may come back, but seemed overly specialized.
The following program 
L<dbrowsplituniq>
was dropped because it is superseded by L<dbmapreduce>.
L<dmalloc_to_db>
was dropped pending a test cases and examples.

=item ENHANCEMENT

L<dbfilevalidate> now has a C<-c> option to correct errors.

=item NEW

L<html_table_to_db> provides the inverse of
L<db_to_html_table>.

=head2 2.8,  5-Aug-08

Change header format, preserving forwards compatibility.

=item BUG FIX

Complete editing pass over the manual, making sure it aligns 
with fsdb-2.x.

=item SEMI-COMPATIBLE CHANGE

The header of fsdb files has changed, it is now #fsdb, not #h (or #L)
and parsing of -F and -R are also different.
See L<dbfilealter> for the new specification.
The v1 file format will be read, compatibly, but
not written.

=item BUG FIX

L<dbmapreduce> now tolerates comments that preceed the first key,

L<dbroweval> the warnings option was backwards;
now corrected.  As a result, warnings in user code now default off

=item BUG FIX

L<dbcolpercentile> now defaults to assuming the target column is numeric.
The new option C<-N> allows selectin of a non-numeric target.

L<dbsubprocess> now reaps child prcoesses, thus avoiding
running out of processes when used a lot.

=head2 2.12, 16-Oct-08

Finally, a full (non-beta) 2.x release!

=over 4

=item INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE

Jdb has been renamed Fsdb, the flatfile-streaming database.
This change affects all internal Perl APIs,
but no shell command-level APIs.
While Jdb served well for more than ten years,
it is easily confused with the Java debugger (even though Jdb was there first!).
It also is too generic to work well in web search engines.
Finally, Jdb stands for ``John's database'', and we're a bit beyond that.
(However, some call me the ``file-system guy'', so 
one could argue it retains that meeting.)

If you just used the shell commands, this change should not affect you.
If you used the Perl-level libraries directly in your code,
you should be able to rename "Jdb" to "Fsdb" to move to 2.12.

The jdb-announce list not yet been renamed, but it will be shortly.

With this release I've accomplished everything I wanted to
in fsdb-2.x.  I therefore expect to return to boring, bugfix releases.

=item TYPO FIXES

Typo in the F<dbroweval> manual fixed.

=item IMPROVEMENT

There is no longer a comment line to label columns
in F<dbcolneaten>, instead the header line is tweaked to
line up.  This change restores the Jdb-1.x behavior, and
means that repeated runs of dbcolneaten no longer add comment lines
each time.

=item BUG FIX

It turns out  F<dbcolneaten> was not correctly handling trailing spaces
when given the C<-E> option to suppress them.  This regression is now
fixed.

=item EXTENSION

L<dbroweval(1)> can now handle direct references to the last row
via F<$lfref>, a dubious but now documented feature.

=item BUG FIXES

Separators set with C<-C> in F<dbcolmerge> and F<dbcolsplittocols>

(A collection of minor bugfixes, plus a build against Fedora 12.)

=over 4

=item BUG FIX

Loging for 
F<dbmapreduce>
with code refs is now stable
(it no longer includes a hex pointer to the code reference).

=item BUG FIX

Better handling of mixed blank lines in F<Fsdb::IO::Reader>
(see test case F<dbcolize_blank_lines.cmd>).

=item BUG FIX

F<html_table_to_db> now handles multi-line input better,
and handles tables with COLSPAN.

=item BUG FIX

F<dbpipeline> now cleans up threads in an C<eval>
to prevent "cannot detach a joined thread" errors that popped
up in perl-5.10.  Hopefully this prevents a race condition
that causes the test suites to hang about 20% of the time
(in F<dbpipeline_first_fails>).

=item IMPROVEMENT

F<dbmapreduce> now detects and correctly fails
when the input and reducer have incompatible 
field seperators.

=item IMPROVEMENT

F<dbcolstats>, F<dbcolhisto>, F<dbcolscorrelate>, F<dbcolsregression>,
and F<dbrowcount>
now all take an C<-F> option to let one specify the output field seperator
(so they work better with F<dbmapreduce>).

handle (and do not handle) numerical precision problems,
and other general limits.  Thanks to Yuri Pradkin for prompting
this documentation.

in January 2005.

=item ADDITION

New program F<dbcolcopylast> copies the last value of a column
into a new column copylast_column of the next row.
New program requested by Fabio Silva;
useful for convereting dbmultistats output into dbrvstatdiff input.

=item BUG FIX

Several tools (particularly F<dbmapreduce> and F<dbmultistats>) would
report errors like "Unbalanced string table refcount: (1) for "STDOUT"
during global destruction" on exit, at least on certain versions
of Perl (for me on 5.10.1), but similar errors have been off-and-on
for several Perl releases.  Although I think my code looked
OK, I worked around this problem with a different way of handling
standard IO redirection.

=head2 2.23, 2011-03-10
Several small portability bugfixes; improved F<dbcolstats> for large datsets

=over 4

=item IMPROVEMENT

Documentation to F<dbrvstatdiff> was changed to use "sd" to refer to
standard deviation, not "ss" (which might be confused with sum-of-squares).

=item BUG FIX

This documentation about F<dbmultistats> was missing the F<-k> option
in some cases.

=item BUG FIX

F<dbmapreduce> was failing on MacOS-10.6.3 for some tests with
the error

    dbmapreduce: cannot run external dbmapreduce reduce program (perl TEST/dbmapreduce_external_with_key.pl)

The problem seemed to be only in the error, not in operation.
On MacOS, the error is now suppressed.
Thanks to Alefiya Hussain for providing access to a Mac system
that allowed debugging of this problem.

=item IMPROVEMENT

The F<csv_to_db> command requires an external
Perl library (F<Text::CSV_XS>).  On computers that
lack this optional library, previously Fsdb would configure
with a warning and then test cases would fail.
Now those test cases are skipped with an additional warning.

=item BUG FIX

The test suite now supports alternative valid output, as a hack
to account for last-digit floating point differences.
(Not very satisfying :-(

=item BUG FIX

F<dbcolstats> output for confidence intervals on very large
datasets has changed.  Previously it failed for more than 2^31-1
records, and handling of T-Distributions with thousands of rows
was a bit dubious.  Now datasets with more than 10000 are considered
infinitely large and hopefully correctly handled.

Improvements to fix an old bug in dbmapreduce with different field separators

=over 4

=item IMPROVEMENT

The F<dbfilealter> command had a C<--correct> option to
work-around from incompatible field-seperators,
but it did nothing.  Now it does the correct but sad, data-loosing
thing.

=item IMPROVEMENT

The F<dbmultistats> command
previously failed with an error message when invoked
on input with a non-default field separator.
The root cause was the underlying F<dbmapreduce>
that did not handle the case of reducers that generated
output with a different field separator than the input.
We now detect and repair incompatible field separators.
This change corrects a problem originally documented and detected
in Fsdb-2.20.
Bug re-reported by Unkyu Park.

A release with actual improvements to dbfilepivot and dbrowuniq.

=over 4

=item BUG FIX

Documentation fixes: typos in L<dbcolscorrelated>,
bugs in L<dbfilepivot>,
clarification for comment handling in L<Fsdb::IO::Reader>.

=item IMPROVEMENT

Previously L<dbfilepivot> assumed the input was grouped by keys
and didn't very that pre-condition.
Now there is no pre-condition (it will sort the input by default),
and it checks if the invariant is violated.

=item BUG FIX

Previously L<dbfilepivot> failed if the input had comments (oops :-);
no longer.

=item IMPROVEMENT

Now L<dbrowuniq> has the C<-L> option to preserve the last
unique row (instead of the first), a common idiom.

=item NEW

New L<dbfilediff> does fsdb-aware file differencing.
It does not do smart intuition of add/removes like Unix diff(1),
but it does know about columns, and with C<-E>, it does
numeric-aware differences.

=item IMPROVEMENT

Test suites that are numeric now use L<dbfilediff> to do numeric-aware
comparisons, so the test suite should now be robust to slightly different
computers and operating systems and complilers than I<exactly> what I use.

All programs that use temporary files 
(L<dbcolpercentile>, L<dbcolscorrelate>, L<dbcolstats>, L<dbcolstatscores>)

=item EXPERIMENTAL ENHANCEMENT

Yet more parallelism in L<dbmerge>:
new "endgame-mode" builds a merge tree of processes at the end

=item BUG FIX

Handling of NamedTmpfiles now supports concurrency.
This fix will hopefully fix occasional
"Use of uninitialized value $_ in string ne at ...NamedTmpfile.pm line 93."
errors.

=item BUG FIX

Fsdb now requires perl 5.10.
This is a bug fix because some test cases used to require it,
but this fact was not properly documented.
(Back-porting to 5.008 would require removing all C<//> operators.)

=item ENHANCEMENT

Fsdb now handles automatic compression of file contents.
Enable compression with C<dbfilealter -Z xz>
(or C<gz> or C<bz2>).
All programs should operate on compressed files
and leave the output with the same level of copmresion.
C<xz> is recommended as fastest and most efficient.
C<gz> is produces unrepeatable output (and so has no
output test), it seems to insist on adding a timestamp.

A major change--all threads are gone.

=over 4

=item ENHANCEMENT

Fsdb is now thread free and only uses processes for parallelism.
This change is a big change--the entire motivation for Fsdb-2
was to exploit parallelism via threading.
Parallelism--good, but perl threading--bad for performance.
Horribly bad for performance.
About 20x worse than pipes on my box.
(See perl bug #119445 for the discussion.)

=item NEW

C<Fsdb::Support::Freds> provides a thread-like abstraction over forking,
with some nice support for callbacks in the parent upon child termination.

=item ENHANCEMENT

Details about removing theads:
C<dbpipeline> is thread free,
and new tests to verify each of its parts.
The easy cases are C<dbcolpercentile>, 
C<dbcolstats>, C<dbfilepivot>, C<dbjoin>, and
C<dbcolstatscores>, each of which use it in simple ways (2013-09-09).
C<dbmerge> is now thread free (2013-09-13),
but was a signficant rewrite,
which brought C<dbsort> along.
C<dbmapreduce> is partly thread free (2013-09-21),
again as a rewrite,
and it brings C<dbmultistats> along.
Full C<dbmapreduce> support took much longer (2013-10-02).

L<dbcolcreate> will create all columns at the head of each row
with the C<--first> option.

=item NEW

L<dbfilecat> will concatinate two files,
verifying that thye have the same schema.

=item ENHANCEMENT

L<dbmapreduce> now passes comments through, 
rather than eating them as before.

Also, L<dbmapreduce> now supports a C<--> option to prevent misinterpreting
sub-program parameters as for dbmapreduce.

=item INCOMAPTIBLE CHANGE

L<dbmapreduce> no longer figures out if it needs to add the key
to the output.  For multi-key-aware reducers, it never does
(and cannot).  For non-multi-key-aware reducers,
it defaults to add the key and will now fail if the reducer adds the key
(with error "dbcolcreate: attempt to create pre-existing column...").
In such cases, one must disable adding the key with the new
option C<--no-prepend-key>.

=item INCOMAPTIBLE CHANGE

L<dbmapreduce> no longer copies the input field separator by default.
For multi-key-aware reducers, it never does
(and cannot).  For non-multi-key-aware reducers,
it defaults to I<not> copying the field separator,
but it will copy it (the old default) with the C<--copy-fs> option

cleanup from de-thread-ification

=over 4

=item BUG FIX

Corrected a fast busy-wait in L<dbmerge>.

=item ENHANCEMENT

Endgame mode enabled in L<dbmerge>; it (and also large cases of L<dbsort>)
should now exploit greater parallelism.

=item BUG FIX

Test case with C<Fsdb::BoundedQueue> (gone since 2.44) now removed.

=back

=head2 2.46, 2013-10-08
continuing cleanup of our no-threads version

=over 4

=item BUG FIX

Fixed some packaging details.
(Really, threads are no longer required,
missing tests in the MANIFEST.)

=item IMPROVEMENT

L<dbsort> now better communicates with the merge process to avoid
bursty parallelism.

L<Fsdb::IO::Writer> now can take C<-autoflush => 1>
for line-buffered IO.

=back

=head2 2.47, 2013-10-12
test suite cleanup for non-threaded perls

=over 4

=item BUG FIX

Removed some stray "use threads" in some test cases.
We didn't need them, and these were breaking non-threaded perls.

=item BUG FIX

Better handling of Fred cleanup;
should fix intermittent L<dbmapreduce> failures on BSD.

=item ENHANCEMENT

Improved test framework to show output when tests fail.
(This time, for real.)
