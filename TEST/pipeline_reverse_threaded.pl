# and fails others.  It fails more often with sleep().
# The bug is that I didn't thread->join the threads, so the exit 
# below was terminating them.  Who knew that perl didn't do an implicit join?
# See perl bug #48214 for my proposed resolution.

# This code was all about perl threads; not clear it ports to Freds.
